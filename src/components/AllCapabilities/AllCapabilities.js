                    Basic Life Support (BLS) includes the provision of basic
                    medically necessary supplies and services with Emergency
                    Medical Technicians (EMTs). BLS requires knowledge and
                    skills in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), using
                    automated external defibrillators (AED), providing oxygen
                    therapy, and relieving airway obstructions in patients of
                    all ages. BLS ambulance transports provide necessary
                    pre-hospital, post-hospital, and non-emergency medical care
                    transportation for critical, non-critical, and emergent
                    patients not requiring cardiac monitoring. EMTs have the
                    essential knowledge and skills needed to stabilize and
                    safely transport patients ranging from non-emergency and
                    routine medical transports to life-threatening emergencies.
                    EMTs’ function as part of a comprehensive EMS response
                    system, while under medical oversight. EMTs perform
                    interventions with the necessary equipment typically found
                    on an ambulance. EMTs are an essential link between the
                    scene of an emergency as well as the health care system.

                    Speciality Care/ SCT includes the provision of specialized
                    medical teams with essential and critical supplies by
                    specially trained advanced medical professionals as defined
                    by the local state department of health where the transport
                    takes place. Specialty Care or Critical Care Transports
                    offer specialized care for patients who require additional
                    medical expertise, which is outside the scope of practice of
                    a regular trained Paramedic. Specialty Teams can transport
                    neonatal patients as well as pediatric intensive care
                    patients. Other specialized medical personnel includes
                    Respiratory Therapists, Critical Care Nurses, Critical Care
                    Paramedics, Physicians, Perfusionist, Cardiologist, and
                    more. These specialty care ambulances are essential to
                    ensure that extremely critical patients receive precise care
                    and monitoring from trained medical professionals during
                    their transport.

                    Bariatric transports require a specially equipped stretcher

                    accommodate most patients who weigh more than 300 pounds or
                    137kgs. Based on our experience before each Bariatric
                    transport, we recommend getting the exact measurements.
                    Indicating the patient’s condition and medical requirements
                    to properly coordinate safe care and flowless loading and
                    unloading for these unique patients. If necessary, there is
                    a form to download for each bariatric patient (or caregiver)
                    to fill out. We look for the prevention, safety, and
                    integrity of each patient and medical personnel. To plan the
                    appropriate fit before transport, please fill out the
